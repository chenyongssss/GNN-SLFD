# GNN-SLFD
This is the github repo for the paper"Conservative semi-lagrangian finite difference scheme for transport simulations using graph neural networks"

We provide two simple numerical examples of this GNN-based method. You can run these .py files to train the model.

## Installation
To test the model, you need install these packages. Make sure you have the corresponding cuda
**Pre-requisites:**

```
Python 3.8.8 or higher
pip install torch==2.2.1+cu121 torchvision==0.13.1+cu121 torchaudio==2.2.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install torch_geometric
```
